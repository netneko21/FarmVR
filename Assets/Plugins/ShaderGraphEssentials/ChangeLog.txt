Change Log:

1.0.0	-	Initial Release.

1.0.1	-	Fixed a bug in SGESimpleLit and SGEUnlit master nodes that made it impossible to work on Mac/Unix systems.

1.0.2	-	Uploaded a new 2019.1 compatible version. 
		- 	The 2018.3 version is unchanged.

1.0.2b	- 	Fixed an issue with permission which was creating errors on load with a 2019.1 project.
1.0.2c	-	Turns out the previous fix was working on windows only; so this version add the permission fix on mac.

1.0.3	-	Added support up to ShaderGraph 5.13.0.

1.0.4	-	2019.1 - LWRP version now requires ShaderGraph 5.13.0 or newer (if you're on 2018.3 or on HDRP you're fine)
			- If you don't want to update to 5.13.0, please contact me.
		-	Added new Custom Lighting master node (LWRP - 2019.1 only)
		-	Added new Toon Lighting master node example (LWRP - 2019.1 only)
		-	In all master nodes, added a "CustomEditor" setting so you can specify custom editor scripts like in regular shaders.

1.0.5	-	Updated SimpleLit master node to follow what Unity's been doing on LWRP/SimpleLit shader.
			- Removed Glossiness node (it wasn't used)
			- Renamed Shininess to Smoothness
		Added a new fix for "Internal Errors" that some users were getting when opening ShaderGraphEssentials the first time (and sometimes on later open too).

1.0.6	-	Introduced the "Getting Started" window. It's useful to both existing and new users!
		-	Restructured how file are organized in the plugin. Also moved the entire plugin from Assets/ShaderGraphEssentials to Assets/Plugins/ShaderGraphEssentials. This has been requested by many users as to reduced the visual clutter of the root folder (as the plugin can't be moved at the moment!).
		-	Move the menu items from SGE to Tools/ShaderGraph Essentials for the same reasons.

1.0.7	- 	Fixed a bug with the default custom lighting graph, referencing a wrong path (hlsl file).
		-	Fixed a minor bug that was throwing an GUI error the first time the Getting Started window was opened
		- 	Fixed a bug that blocked the Getting Started window to import the HDRP package or demo scenes

1.0.8	- 	If you're on Unity 2019.1.3 or newer and using LWRP, then you need to update to LWRP/ShaderGraph 5.16.1 when getting this version.
		- 	Fixed a bug in SimpleLit / CustomLit shaders. The bug was giving errors in editor, but the shader was still working in editor and in builds.
		- 	Fixed the version number in Getting Started window being wrong.

1.0.9	- 	Only impacts 2019.2; if you're on 2018 or 2019.1 it's not useful to update.
		- 	Add 2019.2 support (require ShaderGraph / SRP 6.9.1 and not 6.9.0 which contains a bug with custom functions and subgraphs). If you update from 2019.1, please delete the ShaderGraph Essentials folder and re-download the new one after upgrade to make sure there're no leftover files.
		- 	Removed some demo shaders that were unused and fixed minor bugs in other demo shaders

1.1.0	- 	Added new setting in all SGE master nodes: "Update Vertex Position".
		- 	Added new water demo scene and shaders, with vertex displacement and depth-based foam to showcase the new setting
		-	Red-did the entire SGE asset store page, marketing visuals and added an extensive online doc
